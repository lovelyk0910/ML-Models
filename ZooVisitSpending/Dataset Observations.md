DATASET OBSERVATIONS
Statistical Significance: The variables VisitSpending, PartySize, and MilesFromZoo are statistically significant, with p-values below 0.05.

Variance Explained: Party size, miles from the zoo, and zoo membership account for 75.9% of the variance in zoo spending.

Impact of Party Size: Each additional guest increases zoo spending by 9.13 units.

Impact of Membership: Zoo members spend 14.91 units less per visit than non-members, likely due to savings from membership plans.

Impact of Distance: Guests spend 0.88 units more for each additional mile traveled to the zoo, suggesting further travelers tend to spend more.

Multicollinearity & Correlation: No multicollinearity detected (VIFs < 5, tolerance > 0.2); no high pairwise correlations (all < 0.7) between independent variables.
